## Testing

### Unit tests

Unit tests are automatically executed after every commit made to the repository. Results are available for:

- GNU/Linux: https://travis-ci.org/SwissTierrasColombia/Asistente-LADM-COL

To run the tests locally you need to have *docker* and *docker-compose* installed. We suggest to:
- Download *docker* from the [official site](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community). For instance, for Ubuntu / Linux_Mint follow the steps in [Install using the convenience script](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-using-the-convenience-script).
- Install *docker-compose* using the [binaries](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases).
- NOTE: [installing Docker](https://www.how2shout.com/how-to/how-to-install-docker-ce-on-ubuntu-20-04-lts-focal-fossa.html) on Ubuntu 20.04 is easier.

Before running unit tests, you need to set these 2 environment variables (make sure you use your own repository's root path for the first one):

```sh
export GITHUB_WORKSPACE=/home/Asistente-LADM-COL
export QGIS_TEST_VERSION="release-3_16"
```

The command to execute unit tests is (execute from the repository's root folder):

```sh
docker-compose -f .docker/docker-compose.yml run --rm qgis
```

If you need to recreate the docker image, you can use:
```sh
docker-compose -f .docker/docker-compose.yml down --rmi local && docker-compose -f .docker/docker-compose.yml build
```

### Assisted tests (for the GUI)

The LADM-COL Assistant uses *QGIS Tester* plugin to support assisted tests for GUI functionalities. 

Prerrequisites:

In order to run the assisted tests, you need to install:

- *QGIS Tester* plugin (available at: https://github.com/planetfederal/qgis-tester-plugin).
- *qgiscommons* library: ```pip install qgiscommons```

See [the docs](https://github.com/planetfederal/qgis-tester-plugin/blob/master/docs/source/usage.rst) for usage instructions.

If these prerrequisites are not met, the LADM-COL Assistant will continue running smoothly and will put a warning in the QGIS log.
