# LADM_COL Assistant
[QGIS](http://qgis.org) plugin to capture and maintain data compliant with [LADM_COL](https://github.com/AgenciaImplementacion/LADM_COL) as well as generate [INTERLIS](http://www.interlis.ch/index_e.htm) interchange files (.XTF).

## Functionalities

The current version ([0.3.0](https://github.com/AgenciaImplementacion/Asistente-LADM_COL/releases/tag/0.3.0)) of the LADM_COL Assistant depends on [Project Generator](https://github.com/opengisch/projectgenerator/) plugin v3.2.3 (or higher) and allows users to:

 - Capture data for the LADM_COL v2.2.1 model.
 - Preprocess points: Controlled Measurement.
 - Add points to the `Boundary Point`, `Survey Point` and `Control Point` layers:
   - From CSV files.
     - Validate and avoid insertion of overlapping points.
   - From another layer with any structure, setting a field mapping.
 - Define `Boundaries`:
   - By digitizing on the map.
     - Aids for digitization:
       - Automatic snapping configuration and default field values.
       - Explode selected lines (split per segment).
       - Merge selected lines.
   - From another layer with any structure, setting a field mapping.
 - Create `Plot`:
   - From selected boundaries.
   - From another layer with any structure, setting a field mapping.
 - Fill topology tables automatically:
   - `BFS Points` (relates `Boundary Points` to `Boundary`)
   - `More BFS` (relates `Boundaries` to `Plot`)
   - `Less` (relates `Plots` to their inner rings)
 - Create `Parcels`:
   - From existing `Plots`.
   - From another table with any structure, setting a field mapping.
 - Create `Buildings` and `Building Units`:
   - By digitizing on the map.
     - Aids for digitization:
       - Automatic snapping configuration and default field values.
   - From another layer with any structure, setting a field mapping.
 - Create `Natural Parties` and `Legal Parties`:
   - Using preconfigured forms.
   - From another table with any structure, setting a field mapping.
 - Create `Spatial Sources` and `Administrative Sources`:
   - Using preconfigured forms.
   - From another table with any structure, setting a field mapping.
 - Create `Rights`, `Restrictions` and `Responsibilities`:
   - Using preconfigured forms (linking the new object to selected `Administrative Sources`).
   - From another table with any structure, setting a field mapping.
 - Select in a dialog layers to load from any model in the database or schema:
   - Use the 'Project Generator' plugin (a prerequisite) to load layers with configured forms, relations and domains.
   - Load preconfigured layer sets.
 - Check quality:
   - Check too long `Boundary` segments (exceeding a given tolerance).
   - Check overlaps in `Boundary Points`.
   - Check overlaps in `Control Points`.
   - Check overlaps in `Boundary`.
   - Check overlaps in `Plot`.
   - Check missing `Boundary Points` in `Boundaries`.
   - Check dangles in `Boundary`.
 - Configure automatic values for `namespace` and `local_id` attributes.
 - Load styles for newly added layers from preconfigured QML files.
 - View illustrative GIFs in the plugin's online help or download them for offline work.

## Testing

Unit tests are automatically executed after every commit made to the repository. Results are available for:

- GNU/Linux: https://travis-ci.org/AgenciaImplementacion/Asistente-LADM_COL
- Windows: http://portal.proadmintierra.info:18000/

To run the tests locally you need to have *docker* and *docker-compose* installed. We suggest to:
- Download *docker* from the [official site](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download). For instance, for Ubuntu / Linux_Mint follow the steps in [Install using the convenience script](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-using-the-convenience-script).
- Install *docker-compose* using the [binaries](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/1.18.0).

The command to execute unit tests is (execute from the repository's root folder):
```sh
docker-compose run --rm qgis
```

If you need to recreate docker image, you can use:
```sh
docker-compose down --rmi local && docker-compose build
```
