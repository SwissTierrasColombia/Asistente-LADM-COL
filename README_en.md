# LADM_COL Assistant
[QGIS](http://qgis.org) plugin to capture and maintain data compliant with [LADM_COL](https://github.com/AgenciaImplementacion/LADM_COL) as well as to generate [INTERLIS](http://www.interlis.ch/index_e.htm) interchange files (.XTF).

## Functionalities

The current version ([1.8.0](https://github.com/AgenciaImplementacion/Asistente-LADM_COL/releases/tag/1.8.0)) of the LADM_COL Assistant depends on [QGIS Model Baker v4.2.3](https://github.com/opengisch/QgisModelBaker/releases/download/v4.2.3/QgisModelBaker.v4.2.3.zip) and allows users to:

 - Capture data for the `CATASTRO_REGISTRO_NUCLEO v2.2.1` model.
 - Capture data for the `FICHA_PREDIAL v2.2.1` model.
 - Capture data for the `AVALÚOS v2.2.1` model.
 - Create database structures for the aforementioned models.
 - Import data from transfer files (.XTF).
 - Export data to transfer files (.XTF).
 - Import/export data from/to transfer files (.XTF) disabling data validation.
 - Search for LADM_COL data by component:
   - Basic information.
   - Legal information.
   - Property record card information.
   - Physical information.
   - Economic information.
 - Preprocess points: Controlled Measurement.
   - Group points by nearness.
   - Average point position from points of the same group.
 - Add points to the `Boundary Point`, `Survey Point` and `Control Point` layers:
   - From CSV files.
     - Validate and avoid insertion of overlapping points.
   - From another layer with any structure, setting a field mapping.
 - Define `Boundaries`:
   - By digitizing on the map.
     - Aids for digitization:
       - Automatic snapping configuration and default field values.
       - Build boundaries from selected lines.
   - From another layer with any structure, setting a field mapping.
 - Create `Plot`:
   - From selected boundaries.
   - From another layer with any structure, setting a field mapping.
 - Fill topology tables automatically:
   - `BFS Points` (relates `Boundary Points` to `Boundary`)
   - `More BFS` (relates `Boundaries` to `Plot`)
   - `Less` (relates `Plots` to their inner rings)
 - Create `Right of Way`:
   - By digitizing on the map the polygon or a centerline with width.
     - Aids for digitization:
       - Automatic snapping configuration and default field values.
   - From another layer with any structure, setting a field mapping.
   - Create relations of benefited and restricted `Parcels`.
 - Associate addresses to `Plots`, `Buildings` and `Unit Buildings`.
 - Create `Parcels`:
   - Using preconfigured forms.
     - And associating the new `Parcel` to selected `Plots` and/or `Buildings`.
   - From another table with any structure, setting a field mapping.
 - Create `Buildings` and `Building Units`:
   - By digitizing on the map.
     - Aids for digitization:
       - Automatic snapping configuration and default field values.
   - From another layer with any structure, setting a field mapping.
 - Create `Natural Parties` and `Legal Parties`:
   - Using preconfigured forms.
   - From another table with any structure, setting a field mapping.
 - Create `Group Party`:
   - Using a preconfigured form.
 - Create `Spatial Sources` and `Administrative Sources`:
   - Using preconfigured forms.
     - And associating the new `Spatial Source` to selected `Plots`, `Boundaries` or `Points`.
   - From another table with any structure, setting a field mapping.
 - Create `Source Files`:
   - Associate sources to source files.
   - Upload source files to a server at saving-edits time or later, in batch mode.
 - Create `Rights`, `Restrictions` and `Responsibilities`:
   - Using preconfigured forms (associating the new object to selected `Administrative Sources`).
   - From another table with any structure, setting a field mapping.
 - Create `Propert Record Card`, `Market Research`, `Nuclear Family`, `Natural Party` and `Legal Party`:
   - Using preconfigured forms.
   - From another table with any structure, setting a field mapping.
 - Select in a dialog layers to load from any model in the database or schema:
   - Use the 'QGIS Model Baker' plugin (a prerequisite) to load layers with configured forms, relations and domains.
   - Load preconfigured layer sets.
 - Check quality rules (topology):
   - Check too long `Boundary` segments (exceeding a given tolerance).
   - Check overlaps in `Boundary Points`.
   - Check overlaps in `Control Points`.
   - Check overlaps in `Boundary`.
   - Check overlaps in `Plot`.
   - Check overlaps in `Building`.
   - Check overlaps in `Right of Way`.
   - Check missing `Boundary Points` that do not have `Boundary` nodes correctly associated.
   - Check missing `Boundary` nodes that do not have `Boundary Points` correctly associated.
   - Check dangles in `Boundary`.
   - Check that `Boundaries` are not split.
   - Check overlaps between `Right of Way` and `Building`.
   - Check that `Plots` have no gaps in between.
   - Check that `Plot` boundaries are covered by `Boundaries` and their relations are correctly recorded in topology tables (`MoreBFS` and `Less`).

## Testing

Unit tests are automatically executed after every commit made to the repository. Results are available for:

- GNU/Linux: https://travis-ci.org/AgenciaImplementacion/Asistente-LADM_COL
- Windows: http://portal.proadmintierra.info:18000/

To run the tests locally you need to have *docker* and *docker-compose* installed. We suggest to:
- Download *docker* from the [official site](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community). For instance, for Ubuntu / Linux_Mint follow the steps in [Install using the convenience script](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-using-the-convenience-script).
- Install *docker-compose* using the [binaries](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases).

The command to execute unit tests is (execute from the repository's root folder):
```sh
docker-compose run --rm qgis
```

If you need to recreate docker image, you can use:
```sh
docker-compose down --rmi local && docker-compose build
```
