Basic Administrative Unit
==========================

Parcel
--------

1. Based on existing plot

Choose this option if you want to create a **Parcel** based on existing plots.

**Parcel** is a specialized *BA Unit* class, which describes the basic
administrative unit of Colombian cadastre. The **Parcel** is the legal
territorial unit, which is formed by the plot and may or may not have associated
constructions.

2. From another QGIS layer/table (setting a field mapping)

Choose this option to open a window that allows you to import data from a source table into the *LADM_COL* **predio** table.

If the field structure of input and target tables differs, you can set a field
mapping to define field transformations and correspondence.
